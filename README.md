# IAQF_HHM_NN_tensorflow
I am participating in IAQF 2022 competition. This year, we are asked to predict market states - bull, static and bull - in order to construct a trading strategy that will beat the buy-and-hold strategy. The codes are authored by Simon Chua and me. I will organize the file after the compeition due date.
