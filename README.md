# IAQF_HHM_NN_tensorflow_ClassicalModel
I am participating in IAQF 2022 competition. This year, we are asked to predict market states - bull, static and bull - in order to construct a trading strategy that will overtake the buy-and-hold strategy. The codes are authored by Jonathan Sun, Simon Chou, and Wenyi Huang. I will organize the file after the compeition dues.
